# Benchmark-Suite-on-Bosch-Motors
This project is my master thesis and also a sub-project of the research project AgiProbot from KIT and Bosch. We develop a benchmark including 2D synthetic image datasets and 3D synthetic point cloud datasets, in which the key objects have multiple learn-able attributes with ground truth provided. In this project, small electric motors are used as the key objects.
